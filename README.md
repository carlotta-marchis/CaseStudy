# CaseStudy
This program simulates a game to climb the steps of the Empire State Building.

You roll a dice 100 times:

- with 1 or 2 you go one step down;
- with 2, 3 or 4 you go one step up;
- with 6 you go up by the amount you get by rolling the dice again;
- can't go below step 0;
- 0.1% chance of falling down the stairs.

Bet you'll go 60 steps high.

What is the chance you will win the bet?
